### Deprecation warning

This package has been deprecated in favor of the [fusionauth-typescript-client](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-typescript-client). You can either download releases from its github page or view the npm browser instructions inside that repo.

We will continue to publish this package for several more versions before we archive it and fully deprecate its use. Please make arrangements to migrate to the typescript client soon.

## Upgrade Policy

This library is built automatically to keep track of the FusionAuth API, and may also receive updates with bug fixes, security patches, tests, code samples, or documentation changes.

These releases may also update dependencies, language engines, and operating systems, as we\'ll follow the deprecation and sunsetting policies of the underlying technologies that it uses.

This means that after a dependency (e.g. language, framework, or operating system) is deprecated by its maintainer, this library will also be deprecated by us, and will eventually be updated to use a newer version.
