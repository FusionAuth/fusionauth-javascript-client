### Deprecation warning

This package has been deprecated in favor of the [fusionauth-typescript-client](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-typescript-client). You can either download releases from its github page or view the npm browser instructions inside that repo.

We will continue to publish this package for several more versions before we archive it and fully deprecate its use. Please make arrangements to migrate to the typescript client soon.
